# Cura Custom Printjob Naming

This plugin lets the user customise the prefix and postfix for print jobs (gcode files) on a per-printer basis. It also lets the user set a folder to save files to, for selected outputs such as the removable drive output device.

Formerly known as Custom Printjob Prefix.
