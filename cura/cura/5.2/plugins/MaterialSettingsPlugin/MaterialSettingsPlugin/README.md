# MaterialSettingsPlugin

This plugin allows the user to add more print settings for materials on the `Materials` pane of the preferences.

To configure which settings are included in the `Print Settings` tab on the `Materials` pane of the preferences, press the "Select settings" button. If you add a value for a setting to a material and subsequently hide the setting, the value will still be active in the material. To remove a setting value from the material, press the revert arrow next to the setting value. The value will then revert to the value defined by the printer definition, or the default value for all materials.

This plugin does not change the fact that if a setting value is specified in the "sidebar" settings or in a quality profile, this always overrides the value set for the material.
